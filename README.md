Note I wrote this code a fairly long time ago in a dissertation that was heavy on maths and light on coding,  it is certainly not very efficient or well written.  

## Synopsis

The code-base accompanying my Durham University, Mathematics III, project "Image segmentation with Markov Random Fields".  

## Installation

The executable JAR file "MRFImageSegmentation.JAR" presents a user interface to explore examples and regenerate any images used in my report, presentation and poster.
